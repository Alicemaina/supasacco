                             <p>The Samburu Game Reserve is located on the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro River covering 165km2 and situated 350km from Nairobi. The Samburu National Reserve was one of the two areas in which conservationists George Adamson and Joy Adamson raised Elsa the Lioness, made famous in the best-selling book and award winning movie, Born Free and is also the home of Kamunyak (the blessed one), a lioness who adopted six oryx calves between 2002 and 2003.</p>

                             <p>The Buffalo Springs National Reserve is separated from the Samburu National Reserve by the Ewaso Ngiro River. It is less hilly and less dense than Samburu but equally attractive. Buffalo Springs takes its name from an oasis of clear water at the western end of the sanctuary. The Reserve is 131Km2 and lies on the leeward side of Mount Kenya, rarely receiving rain. During the struggle for independence in Kenya, Mau Mau freedom fighters hid in the park. The legendary Mau Mau General Mathenge passed through when fleeing to Ethiopia. There is a pool of spring water caused by bombing during the 2nd World War by European forces. Attractions in the park are over 365 species of birds, reticulated giraffe, gravyâ€™s zebra, elephant, beisa oryx, somali ostrich, hippo, crocodile, gerenuk, buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah, hyena and the spring pool.</p>

                             <p>Shaba National Game Reserve is a rugged wilderness featuring hot springs, rolling savannah, miles of scrub and desert, a waterfall and the Ewaso Ngiro River which supports a diversity of wildlife. This reserve was established in 1968. A solitary mountain rises to 2,145m from an otherwise flat area. Attractions are the gravy zebra, the somali ostrich, gerenuk, the reticulated giraffe, gazelles, lesser kudu, leopard, lion, elephants and bird life.</p>
